            There is no denying that human exploration has, intentionally or unintentionally, brought more aliens to the South. Take a look at this chart to see how species were introduced to the region.

            As explorers ventured further south, they took passengers of all kinds with them. Mice, rats, cats, ponies and wolves were some of the many aliens that made an appearance in the region. And some of these stayed to wreak all sorts of havoc on the local ecologies.

            From a first glance at this chart, it might be hard to understand why aliens would pose a problem if only a few are finally classified as invasive.
